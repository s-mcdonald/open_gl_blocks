# Blocks ;;

##### About
Blocks is my first OpenGL program to help me learn about OGL, rendering and some basic game development using c++.
I have designed this in such a way I can expand from the initial `Blocks` environment to build the next
game which will be my version of `Snakes`.

So Blocks will implement a 2D flat plane in which blocks will spawn.
To consider the Snakle game on how I want to build it, the Blocks will have a specific behaviour
to how I want the Snakes game to work.

* Blocks can spawn randomly
* Blocks can be 1 of 3 colours
* Each colour containing a value
    * Red = 1 
    * Yellow = 2
    * Blue = 3
* Multiple Blockis Can spawn
* Red Blocks have a lifetime (min 1 second)
* Blocks can not spawn on or adjacent to other blocks


To end the environment F1 to call game over.

Note that Blocks is not a game, refer to my snakes game.
